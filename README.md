# ðŸ§µ Loom
### The next generation Minecraft server software.

Loom is an implementation of the [Loom API](https://github.com/LoomDev/Loom-API) on vanilla Minecraft. Loom was inspired heavily by CraftBukkit, but with the goal to make minimal NMS modifications in order to implement its API and completely open-sourced development.

Loom uses Fabric's [yarn](https://github.com/fabricmc/yarn) for its mappings, which allows it to be quickly updated to new and snapshot releases of Minecraft. These mappings are completely open-source and free for any project with it's permissive license, which makes it the best choice for Loom.

### Why Loom?
Loom was created because of the lack of fast version updates from Spigot, CraftBukkit's parent project. Not to mention, Bukkit's ancient, by today's standards, API is in need of rewrites and optimizations. Loom aims to stick as faithful to the original Bukkit API as possible to make it easy for plugin developers to switch over, while also introducing many modern features directly into the API.

### Building Loom
Currently, we don't have written instructions for this step, but we are planning to create something very similar to Spigot's build tools for releasing Loom.

We hope to create a stable and modern server software for many generations of Minecraft servers to come. Loom is completely open-source and licensed with the MIT license. Feel free to contribute to the project! âœ¨
